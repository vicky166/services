          Fractional CO2 laser treatment is an innovative method that uses laser
          energy microbeams to penetrate and break down skin tissue to eliminate
          skin scars, wrinkles, sun damage, fine lines, and more. The method
          provides immediate results and requires multiple sessions to achieve
          long-term benefits.

          The CO2 laser beam is fractionated into thousands of tiny shafts of
          light. The light penetrates the skin, causing it to repair and replace
          damaged skin with new tissue. This also helps to shrink existing
          collagen due to the heat.
